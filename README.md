Led a project focusing on design of flexible pavement. Utilized principles from IRC 37 guidelines, incorporating traffic data and
subgrade characteristics.
Employed IITPav software for accurate structural analysis, stress and stains calculations and determine layers thickness, ensuring
compliance with strain criteria for the design traffic.
